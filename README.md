Boundary OS × Boundary Stability Index (BSI) Toolkit

Version 0.4 — Experimental Research Release
This repository hosts the Boundary OS × BSI analytical toolkit, including:

Conceptual models
Policy-oriented measurement logic
Experimental spreadsheet-based simulators
Appendices supporting academic publication

🔍 What This Is

This project operationalizes Boundary OS (Boundary Operating System) and the Boundary Stability Index (BSI) as tools for:
Policy analysis
Migration & social stability assessment
AI-mediated governance research
Ethical boundary evaluation

It is not:
A decision-making system
A policy recommendation engine
A predictive AI model

🧠 Core Concepts

Boundary OS
A five-layer model of social boundaries:
Material
Physio-Sensory
Affective
Narrative
Social/Institutional

BSI (Boundary Stability Index)
A composite index measuring the stability of boundaries across layers.

STATE_MACHINE
A governance-oriented interpretation layer describing system condition and transitions.

⚙️ How to Use (High-Level)
Describe a case in CASE_INPUT
Generate an AI prompt via Prompt_Generator
Use an external LLM to score layers
Paste scores into LAYER_SCORES
Observe BSI output and state transitions
Interpret results responsibly

⚠️ Ethical & Methodological Constraints

AI is used only for translation and quantification
No intent inference
No automated policy decisions
Human oversight required at all stages
